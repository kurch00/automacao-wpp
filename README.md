<h1>Whatsapp-Automation</h1>

> Status: ⚠️ Developing ⚠️

### It's a automation with Python that use an Excel spreadsheet to take the informations:

+ name
+ birth day
+ birth month
+ birth year
+ phone number

With those informations, the program analyzes if someone has a birthday on this date, 
if the answer is True, the program initialize the automation, but
if the answer is False, at the moment i'm writing this, nothing happend. but I'm working 
on showing a message when no one has a birthday on a certain day.

### The program has also an simple page that you can interect, a interface, with only 2 buttons:

+ Start ('Iniciar')
+ Cancel ('Cancelar')

I made available only the python code, not the excel part, because it has some private informations,
but it is very simple for you to make it. In code, i called the spreadsheet: 'Automação wpp 1.xlsx',
if you want to keep the code the same as what I made available, you can only rename your excel project
to 'Automação 1.xlsx'.

### Techlonogies Used:

+ Python
